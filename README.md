# ❤️ Valantine AI

**Valantine AI** is a frontend-focused chatbot project designed to explore **emotional UX**, **creative writing interfaces**, and **human-friendly interaction design** using modern web technologies.

The project intentionally avoids backend complexity and focuses on **clarity, responsiveness, and user comfort**.

---

Valantine AI was built as a **learning and showcase project** to demonstrate frontend skills through an emotionally engaging AI-style interface.

**Primary goals:**

* Design a calm, emotionally aware chat UI
* Implement rule-based conversational flows
* Experiment with browser-based voice interaction
* Build a clean, mobile-friendly frontend experience

> ⚠️ This is **not a production AI system** and does not use real machine learning models.
