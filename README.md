❤️ Valantine AI

Valantine AI is a frontend-focused AI chatbot experience designed to explore emotional UX, creative writing interfaces, and human-friendly interaction design.

This project intentionally avoids heavy backend complexity and instead focuses on clarity, responsiveness, and user comfort.

🌸 Project Purpose

The goal of Valantine AI is to:

Design a calm, emotional chatbot UI

Experiment with rule-based conversation flows

Explore browser-based voice interaction

Build a clean, mobile-friendly frontend experience

This project is built as a learning + showcase project, not a production AI system.

⚠ Limitations

Rule-based responses (not a real AI model)

No backend authentication

Keep the system easy to debug and explain

🚀 Future Improvements (Optional)
